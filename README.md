This is a Docker image containing a minimal [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
installation (version 2018) on a minimal Alpine Linux base and with a handful
of additional packages used by the Keep Network's whitepaper and other
documentation, including Cyrillic support and support for
[TikZ/PGF](http://www.texample.net/tikz/).

The goal of this container is to be the smallest that provides the needed
components.
